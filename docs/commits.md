## Conventional Commit Messages 

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history. 

 ### Why to use conventional commits?
   * automatically generates chengelogs
   * determine semantic version based on commit message
   * structured commit history

## Commit Formats

### Schema
<pre>
<b><a href="#types">&lt;type&gt;</a></b></font>(<b><a href="#scopes">&lt;optional scope&gt;</a></b>): <b><a href="#subject">&lt;subject&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#body">&lt;optional body&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#footer">&lt;optional footer&gt;</a></b>
</pre>


### Types
* API relevant changes
    * `feat` Commits, that adds a new feature
    * `fix` Commits, that fixes a bug
* `refactor` Commits, that rewrite/restructure your code, however does not change any behaviour. These are not features, new functionalities nor fixes
* `style` Commits, that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* `test` Commits, that add missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `docs` Commits, that affect documentation only
* `build` Commits, that affect build components like build tool, ci pipeline, dependencies, project version, ...
* `ops` Commits, that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery, ...
* `chore` changes without an impact on source code/tests e.g. modifying `.gitignore`, package update
* `ci`changes related to continuous integration, like configd and scripts
* `revert` revert latest changes

### Scopes
The `scope` provides additional contextual information.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* Allowed Scopes depends on the specific project
* Don't use issue identifiers as scopes

### Subject
The `subject` contains a succinct description of the change.
* Is a **mandatory** part of the format
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* Don't capitalize the first letter
* No dot (.) at the end

### Body
The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* This is the place to mention issue identifiers and their relations

### Footer
The `footer` should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to **reference Issues** that this commit refers to.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* **optionally** reference an issue by its id.
* **Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGES:` followed by space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.


### Examples
* ```
  feat(shopping cart): add the amazing button
  ```
* ```
  feat: remove ticket list endpoint
  
  refers to JIRA-1337
  BREAKING CHANGES: ticket enpoints no longer supports list all entites.
  ```
* ```
  fix: add missing parameter to service call
  
  The error occurred because of <reasons>.
  ```
* ```
  build(release): bump version to 1.0.0
  ```
* ```
  build: update dependencies
  ```
* ```
  refactor: implement calculation method as recursion
  ```
* ```
  style: remove empty line
  ```
  
BREAKING CHANGE: is a total change of your code, this is also 
can be used with a previous tag like or with append !
Major Breaking Release 
(Note that the BREAKING CHANGE: token must be in the footer of the commit)
```
perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option

BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.
The default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.
```
